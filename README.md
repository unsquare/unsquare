Hi, I'm Jeff James!

I've been interested in programming and computer languages since I taught myself BASIC on my childhood Apple IIgs.

Nowadays I mostly dabble in web design and automation, usually because I have an annoying problem to solve and want to save time.

I'm also a writer! More information about my portfolio is available at my personal site, <a href="https://unsquare.com">unsquare.com</a>.
